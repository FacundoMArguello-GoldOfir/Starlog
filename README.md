> IPFS Metadata Blockchain based on Substrate

The goal of Starlog is to research and develop a solo chain or potential parachain, which stores metadata for IPFS as non-fungible tokens. Thus, making IPFS data searchable, integrating the concept of ownership and identity for IPFS uploads as well as making it possible to combine content- and location-addressed storage for faster initial loading of non-distributed IPFS content. The project was initiated to improve Dweb.page.
